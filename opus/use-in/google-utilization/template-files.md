## Client Requirement Forms

A single drive folder can contain all the types of forms, named nearly with placeholders in the file name. These can be

- Google Docs
- Google Sheets
- AW Engage

To prevent data collection in a different channel, it is best to copy the template into a triage folder, renaming the file to bear the client name.

In case the client's email is not available, it can be made editable by any with the link. Google links are especially long so cannot be guessed or brute force broken into. Also the open graph preview (file title) will only work if it's shared to public.

These go into a folder per client.

** The **infosec** policy would require blocking access to the task owner so archiving can be done weekly or whenever, using the infuse access report.

## Internal Tasks

These can be Google templates, or AW Engage forms which would need an intranet site setup. Actual content will go from teammate A to B and the advantage is labeling, snoozing etc in Gmail which becomes easy. A unique garbled word uniquely identifies this.

Also, Gmail can be controlled by a shell interface of the intranet site.

## Work Item via Template

These can be centrally located, descriptions and other info embedded in say the file's description, and Opus' Mage used to export the list and display it via the copy drive link modification. As with client templates, this can sit in the intranet or team website.
